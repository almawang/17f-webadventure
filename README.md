# WebAdventure

WebAdventure is a Chrome Extension that provides a unique and fun way of interacting with Wikipedia via a game format. Players interact with webpages in a multiplayer snake game that combines reading content with the competitive multiplayer snake game.

We developed the game by adapting the popular game of Snake and [paper.io](http://www.best.io/paper-io) so that it takes place on the text of a webpage (we choose Wikipedia.com for this iteration). Players fight for control of a webpage by taking up area with the limitation they cannot exceed the boundaries of the content and cannot run into any snake trail (their own or any opponents'). They  As the game runs the player's stats (score, area collected) are displayed to other users.

For mockups of the page, please visit https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/17f-webadventure/wiki and click on the link titled "Link to Figma"

## Architecture

Our Chrome Extension currently injects Javascript into a Wikipedia page and using JQuery to parse and modify the page. The extension code is compiled and built using Babel and Webpack.

On the backend we are using MongoDB and Mongoose to access the data. Visit https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/webadventure-backend for the backend repo.

The frontend and backend communicate via web sockets (using Socket.io).

## Setup

We are using vanilla Javascript, JQuery, HTML and CSS right now to inject the game onto the Wikipedia page.

After pulling the repo run:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then load the unpacked extension onto the [Chrome Extensions](chrome:\\extensions) settings page.

Run the game by clicking on the extension icon and the game will provide instructions.

By default the game uses the deployed backend. To use a locally deployed backend change the socketserver variable in gameData.js

## Deployment

At this stage, we plan to deploy via Chrome extension using Google Developer Tools (chrome://extensions).

Before reloading as an extension, run the command:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
Then add the unpacked extension to Chrome.

Click on the extension.

Have fun!

## Gameplay
To move the snake make sure the Wikipedia page in focus (click on it if it's not) and move using the keys 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'.

The edges of the game are the top and bottom of any given section. Avoid going into an edge and the snake's trail.
